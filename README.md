## Description

<!-- Coding is not the most intuitive. Therefore, the importance of a README is immeasurable. The reason why is because a README holds several purposes. One purpose is to explain the work that's been created, in a way that anyone visiting one's repo (repository) can understand. Other purposes are to showcase the hard work that's been done, and highlight accomplishments, while sharing what was learned throughout the process. For this project, my task was to create a README utilizing node. [Node](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlB_eWDSMt4) is a "program that includes V8 JS engine (Google Chrome), plus additional modules that give us capabilities not in a browser." So what does this mean? It means that one can utilize JavaScript, without leaving the terminal! It is not a programming language, but instead is a "runtime environment for executing JavaScript code". To see the steps I've taken to create this README, please continue to read along, as well as watch my [step-by-step video](https://app.castify.com/view/365613b9-6942-444e-8519-3ca0a19a685f). Also, check out the [generated README ](https://github.com/AmyLipscomb/node-js/tree/main/output) that was created using Node! I hope you enjoy and learn something new! -->
